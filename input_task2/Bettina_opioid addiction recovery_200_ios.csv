""Sober Sidekick gets an A from me. New to sobriety, it feels good to know I’m not alone. Some people have no hope even after a day or hour or minute sober without alcohol. This app makes it easy to seek help from others. As you read their stories, (and share your own)...you established your own community, and nothing but growth comes out of it!”

""I haven’t been on Sober Sidekick very long and 3 days sober doesn’t seem like a long time but I don’t think I would have made through day 1 without finding this incredible community.”

""Sober Sidekick has provided me hope. Being able to sign in and see hundreds of people within the same amount of sober days as you makes me feel like I’m not ever alone with how I’m feeling. Also being able to see people with the amount of sobriety that you dream of having one day gives me sense of direction and proves that one day I CAN get that happiness and self fulfilling love without the use of substances. This app has been my safe place.""

""I have been using Sober Sidekick for a few hours and for the first time in years I actually feel hope. It’s practically a miracle. The amount of sober support is incredible. My higher power sent me here today, when I needed it most. I am so grateful.”

Sobriety Support and Inspiration

My Spiritual Toolkit (MST) Contains NO ADS and NEVER WILL.  100% hardship discounts are available to anyone that can't afford the premium features such as the Gratitude List. Just email nathan@myspiritualtoolkit.com



MST IS a simple set of tools that make it convenient and easy for you and other members of AA / Alcoholics Anonymous work steps 10 and 11 on a daily basis to keep you from relapsing back into active alcoholism.

We are not cured of alcoholism. What we really have is a daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. This app helps US maintain THAT spiritual condition.


Resentment is the number one offender.  Now you can get rid of your resentments fast while on the go with the Spot Check Inventory tool that’s mentioned in Step 10 of the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions Book to help with our daily ups and downs, especially those where people or new events throw us off balance and tempt us to make mistakes.



Do you do a Nightly Inventory as suggested in Step 11 of the Big Book before retiring each night?   You should and now It’s EASY!  With MST just answer 10 simple questions straight from the Big Book and you’re done!  



* Read the AA Daily Reflections Fast!  Quickly get your daily reflection for the day direct from the Alcoholics Anonymous website.



* We are only as sick as our secrets and the alcoholics anonymous recovery program is all about sharing with others, particularly our sponsors.  So My Spiritual Toolkit has a super feature for sharing your inventories, journal and gratitude lists with your sponsor or trusted adviser.  Simply Text or Email your sponsor right from within the app and get feedback fast!



* The spot check inventory tool is similar to a mini step 4 inventory. You can create different inventories based on the big book style - resentment, fear, sex and harms done. 



* This 12 Step App has a sobriety calculator which keeps track of the number of days you are sober for. Just set your sobriety date on the counter and it will automatically calculate how many days you’ve been sober, years sober, months sober, even hours!  Even more fun, you can share this with your sponsor or other trusted advisers from right within the App!






* Gratitude List 


* PIN locking 


* Do you prefer to type on a computer? You can use the accompanying My Spiritual Toolkit Web app from any browser for free!  



Prayers included:

Welcome to Gambless – the best app for your gambling addiction recovery!

Up to 3% of the adult population is estimated to have some degree of gambling problem. However, just 4% of problem gamblers seek treatment, and only 2% ends up receiving professional help. Problem gambling is a disorder comparable to substance abuse, and co-morbidity with other mental issues such as depression and anxiety is as high as 70%. 

Gambless, using a variety of psychology based self improvement articles, self assessment tools, mental wellness workouts, and life improvement courses, helps you cope with the urges to gamble in order to make your life better.

Say yes to evidence based addiction recovery and see your life improve every day. You can change for the better, and we are by your side to support you. With Gambless, you can bet on yourself!

Use the in-built mood and psychotherapeutic diary to track your moods, emotions, or situations in your personal life that inspired you or make you feel down.

PSYCHOSUTRA - SELF HELP WORKOUTS

As a self coaching app, Gambless features mental workouts for many negative feelings such as shyness, envy, loneliness, apathy, anger, frustration, anxiety, resentment. All mental workouts are neatly divided and feature tasks that you need to perform for long-term self improvement.

PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT COURSES

Whether you want to fight the addiction or develop new skills, like become more attentive or confident, the Gambless Courses can be of great help for your mental wellbeing.

EMERGENCY CHATBOT

Are you having a panic attack? Your anxiety is overwhelmingly high? Have you had an argument and the urges to gamble are over the roof? Are you having troubles coping after a traumatic event? Do you need to vent away but no one is there to listen? Use the Emergency section and let's talk it over. We guarantee you that you'll feel better after a therapeutic chat.

Overcome your addiction and start a positive shift in your mental wellbeing now!

Gambless is based on psycho-education, which is often the first step for mental health improvement, and it consists in providing information and support to better understand and cope with a certain condition or emotionally straining circumstance. While it does not substitute psychotherapy, Gambless can be a powerful complement to classic therapy, and it can be a great tool where a psychologist help is not easily accessible or affordable.

Pocket Rehab allows the user to retain 100% anonymity. This is useful for everyone from the everyday person to business professionals, teachers, military officials, celebrities, to public figures.

What is COR-12?
In 2012, under the leadership of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation’s chief medical officer, Marv Seppala, MD, a new treatment protocol was designed to address the specific needs of opioid-dependent patients. The new protocol, Comprehensive Opioid Response with the Twelve Steps, or COR-12, embraces the latest and best research that indicated certain medications can be used to improve treatment engagement and future recovery outcomes for people with opioid use disorders.

Hazelden Publishing, a division of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, offers a comprehensive solution set to professional organizations to address the opioid epidemic by mobilizing best practices from the COR-12 treatment and recovery approach for their own patients and clients.

"Confidant: Healthy Habits","Confidant Health","N/A","live.safeopioidusecoalition.confidant","When you or someone you love is using drugs or alcohol, it can be hard to get help. 

Confidant is something new and different in addiction recovery.

Most addiction recovery clinics focus on 12-step based abstinence-focused sobriety. For many people, that path is outdated and doesn’t fit the lifestyle of those who haven’t hit “rock bottom”. 

We know there are millions of people, like us, who want to change the way they’re using drugs and alcohol without having to put their life on hold by going to drug rehab or an intensive outpatient program for the next 30 days to get sober.

So, we teamed up with modern-recovery researchers and patient advocates to dive into the latest scientific evidence and medical knowledge to uncover the best way to make changes to your alcohol or drug use.

What we found was a simpler way - focused on the person, not just the substance. You should not have have to uproot your life, question every choice you’ve ever made, and become an unrecognizable person. 

Addiction recovery should be person-centered, straightforward and judgment free. Whether that means Medication-Assisted Treatment like Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, etc. or online therapy we support a variety of paths.

Here’s how Confidant works:

- Download the app
- Start ReVAMP- our behavior change platform
- Speak with providers who can help you in 1:1 therapy
- Book online therapy appointments right in the app
- Meet with healthcare providers on your phone (they can help with Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, etc. if appropriate)

We provide everyone who uses Confidant access to a Matchmaker, who acts as your personal concierge and can answer any questions you may have and get you connected to all these resources.

Not interested in talking with someone about this yet? We get it. Talking about substance use is hard and it takes time to build trust. That’s why we created ReVAMP to guide you.

ReVAMP is our DIY behavior change program. Simply answer questions about your goals, activities and feelings and it will help you identify your core values. Next ReVAMP produces a personalized plan to help you unlock your best self by drinking less, using drugs less or quitting altogether.

At Confidant, we don’t judge. We’re here to help you and that’s it. 

Confidant Health is perfect if you want to:

- Drink less
- Quit drinking
- Get sober
- Use drugs less
- Quit drugs
- Connect with a Recovery Coach
- Consider sobriety
- Learn about Substance Use Disorder (SUD), Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) or Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)
- Get online therapy
- Receive Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)
- Receive Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, etc.
- Join an online addiction recovery support group
- Explore online rehab or virtual addiction recovery services
- Educate yourself on addiction recovery including AA, NA, holistic therapy, evidence-based approaches and beyond.
- Something more than a drink tracker, sobriety tracker or habit tracker
- Online alternative to addiction treatment centers
- Learn about medications for opioid use
- Learn about medications for alcohol use
- Just feel better!

Who will be helping you at Confidant Health?

You may connect with prescribers who can help with Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) using Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine and others. 

We also have addiction recovery coaches who can help you better understand your relationship to drugs, alcohol and/or your own journey through their own lived experience. 

Confidant Health also has therapists ready to discuss addiction recovery from just using drugs less or drinking less all the way to sobriety. Regardless of your own journey Confidant Health is judgment free and can help you attain your mental health goals.

"12 Steps Sex Addicts Anonymous","LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP NET, LLC.","N/A","com.mysaatoolkit.mytoolkit","My SAA Toolkit (SAAT) is an exciting new recovery tool for members of Sex Addicts Anonymous. It has a journal that makes it easy to find time to write in your journal. Just have access to an internet connection at home (computer) or on the go (mobile devices and tablets) and journal via typing.

It’s like having Your Sponsor in Your Pocket!

It also has a Spot Check Inventory that allows you to quickly get rid of resentments when on the go and you can later add more detail via your computer because all data is securely synced to the cloud using the same security as banks!

Just because you're in recovery doesn’t mean life will slow down. Instead it will move forward, and so must you. Often times moving forward means being on the constant go. In effect, this means that if you're using journaling as part of your recovery, then you don't have time to sit down and write your feelings out.

There’s another problem that arises with paper journaling: privacy. If you mistakenly leave your journal out, someone might ""accidentally"" read it. Although a journal is a private matter and it’s likely closed, people nowadays will still somehow invite themselves to opening your journal; thus, reading your private thoughts.

Oh, what scandals can occur from private information!
It’s so good to know that both of these situations are avoidable – thanks to this SAAT App!

FEATURES:
JOURNAL / DIARY

In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive sexual behavior was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.

With the journal, you simply type in an entry. Whatever you want to express – anger, sadness, joy, etc. – do so with the assurance that your thoughts will remain private. This is because all data is encrypted; you’re the only person who will have access to it. If you want to add an extra sense of security for your own peace of mind, create a fictitious name.

Remember, however, that you’re the only writer and reader in SAAT’s journal. In addition, you can edit and delete entries at any time.

• GRATITUDE LIST
If you create a Gratitude List using My SAA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive sexual behavior!
It’s been proven that if you put aside a minute or two every day to express gratitude for your life you will feel happier, more determined, more energetic, and more optimistic. — This was proven by a series of studies conducted by Psychologists Robert Emmons and Michael McCullough.
“What you focus on expands, and when you focus on the goodness in your life, you create more of it. Opportunities, relationships, even money flowed my way when I learned to be grateful no matter what happened in my life.” — Oprah Winfrey

• SPOT CHECK INVENTORIES
- With Spot Check Inventories, this is an opportunity to quickly express your resentment. When you’re angry, you need to dispose this emotion fast so that it won’t eat at your soul throughout the remainder of the day.

• ABSTINENCE BIRTHDAY CALCULATOR
- View the amount of time you’you've been abstinent from compulsive sexual behavior each time the app is opened.

• ANONYMOUS ICON
- To protect anonymity, the actual app icon does not show references to Sex Addicts Anonymous.

Drinking Alcohol overloads your serotonin receptors and decreases your motivation to meet new people. This can destroy your life if you let it. Don't let Alcohol addiction get the best of you. Get the help you deserve by downloading this free app.

Top 7 reasons to quit drinking alcohol:

1. Your immune system will thank you

Without the negative impacts of alcohol, your immune system will grow stronger. Liquor and other alcohol can wear away linings in the mouth and throat too, making pathogens able to take over more easily. First, it produces an overall nutritional deficiency, depriving the body of valuable immune-boosting nutrients. Second, alcohol, like sugar, consumed in excess can reduce the ability of white cells to kill germs. High doses of alcohol suppress the ability of the white blood cells to multiply, inhibit the action of killer white cells on cancer cells, and lessen the ability of macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factors.

2. No more hangovers

As you age, your body starts to become less efficient at breaking down hangover causing toxins. For those who have experienced a terrible hangover, we don't really need to say anymore here. It is simply not worth it.

3. You will save plenty of money

According to EventBrite, the average partier spends $81 (USD) on a night out drinking and on average, they go out twice a week. Doing some simple math here, that means that you will be saving almost $8500 a year if you cut out the drinking. Invest the money or buy yourself something cool!

4. Your problems actually make sense

When you're drunk, little problems become big problems for no reason. When you're sober, you actually have to face reality and you wont be worried about petty things anymore.

5. You will actually remember things

Have you ever gone out for a night of drinking and didn't remember the night? Or maybe even didn't remember bits and pieces? Well that will not happen anymore if you stop drinking.

6. No more losing friends over drunken mistakes

A lot of bad decisions go out the window when you stop getting drunk, and as a result of making fewer poor decisions, your friends will like you more.

7. It's interesting to go out sober

If you usually went out to get all boozed up with friends, it can be hard to turn back the habit. But you'll realize with time that you don't need booze to have fun. It is a hard habit to kick, but you will become more comfortable with yourself as you progress.

"Addiction AVERT","Reflections of the Heart","N/A","com.rationalsoberliving.AVERT","Addiction AVERT, Rational Reflections 501(c) 3 non-profit

FREE download! Addiction AVERT is a substance abuse craving reduction technique that can help individuals challenge cravings in the immediacy by bringing up realistic events and situations that will happen if they choose to use drugs, alcohol or smoke and what they will lose. AVERT can be customized to help motivate an individual’s personal recovery program and works with a sponsor.     

The organ that is diseased in addiction is the mid-brain which is the part of the brain responsible for our survival (food, sex, fight or flight). The cerebral cortex is responsible for logic, reasoning and moral functioning.   

For the most part the cerebral cortex has power over the mid-brain but in addiction this top down control is lost. The mid-brain actually hijacks the cerebral cortex and makes logic, reasoning and morality a liability, allowing for continued use and the continuation of harmful consequences.

  AVERT helps interrupt this process and restore the top down control needed to successfully interrupt the mid-brains cruel tool (craving); restoring the cerebral cortex leading to rational thinking, which leads to abstinence for the alcoholic and drug addict.  

This app is for your use of motivation only and the use of it accepts that no liability may be held against Rational Reflections, any of its employees or related businesses and/or partners.",5,5,"28.86M","N/A","N/A","2015-02-02","1.4","17+","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/addiction-avert/id533220167?uo=4",0

"Drug Addiction Calendar","App Diggity, LLC","N/A","com.NoDrugsCalendar.scope","Drug addiction among men and women is on the rise. With drug availability in our culture being on the forefront of our minds, it is no surprise that not people realize that this is a problem and can be highly addicting. Drug Addiction Calendar can help you put an end to your drug addiction by holding you accountable, offering solutions, words of encouragement, and science based facts that will help you get past your drug abuse.
 
Features:
1. Use our counter to track your progress down to the second.
2. Create your own reasons to quit drugs, or use one of our scientifically based facts about quitting.
3. Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.
4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed and stop drugs.
5. Our special panic button will help you send a text to a friend that may be able to help you and be an accountability partner.
6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success.

8. Our built in money calculator will show you how much money you have saved since quitting
9. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake your drug addiction. 

 
Take a look at our top 10 reasons to quit using Drugs:

1. Stop the pain!

When you are addicted to drugs, everything you do becomes more painful when you are not on the drugs. Eventually this will fade, but it can be grueling at first, which is why people become addicts in the first place.

2. Change your life

When you look back on your life, do you want to see the person who was addicted to drugs and not contributing to society? I don't think so.

3. Regain your self-esteem

Drugs will get you into a cycle of self-loathing and hate. This is a situation that no one wants to be in. When you are addicted to drugs, you start to think that you are worthless and no one likes you.

4. Be a good parent

It is not just you suffering from a drug addiction; your children are suffering too. Children need a role model to look up to and if that role model is addicted to drugs, then they are going to see that as normal. Even if they never see you use drugs, children will gravitate towards that state of mind.

5. Be a loving spouse

Drug use negatively affects relationships, whether its friendships, dating relationships, families, or marriages. Your spouse needs you to be there for them emotionally and physically. When you are using drugs, you are not there emotionally.

6. Stop being embarrassed

When you are addicted to drugs, pretty much everything you do can be embarrassing. Your family and friends will stop inviting you to places simply because you make a fool out of yourself.

7. Remember the good times

Being addicted to drugs prevents you from remembering the good experiences in life. You absolutely do not need drugs to have a good time, and when you start remembering things more, you will appreciate the good times even more.

8. Be respected by your peers

As a child, you looked up to your parents because they provided for you and gave you unconditional love. At this stage in your life, you need to feel respected in that same way, but the more you use drugs, the less opportunity you are going to have to be respected.

9. Provide for your family

According to Clarity Detox, the average drug addict spends approximately $2,100 - $4,200 per month on various drugs, including heroin and prescription drugs.

10. Develop more friendships 

When you are a drug user, you put your friends on the back burner and using drugs take precedent to being a good friend. You used to know what it was like to be a good friend before you started using drugs, right?

By walking the user through this process, the trigger is identified, the user is led through a series of questions to uncover the core issue to determine a new way to work through the unresolved conflict.

Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to improve your health and nutrient deficiencies while recovering from opioid addiction. If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you!

A number of features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:

• This publication is the only one in the market that offers dietary guidance for OUD AND its combination with the following most likely health issues: anxiety, constipation, dehydration, depression, HIV/AIDS, insomnia, leaky gut, liver well-being, magnesium deficiency, stress, vitamin D deficiency and weight loss.

• Suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.

The primary sources used by this app are US government sources such as USDA (US Department of Agriculture), NIH (National Institute of Health) agencies, and leading clinics & universities.

Personal Remedies is the producer of the world's first e-dietitian and publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions. Based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.

Creation of this app was inspired by the Opioid Crisis Working Group (OCWG) of the StartUp Health Academy. Personal Remedies is a founding member. The OCWG’s goal is to provide an end-to-end, evidence-based solution to recovery clinics and their patients, addressing all the patients’ biological, pharmacological, psychological and sociological needs. This app is a component of that end-to-end solution.

The information presented by this app is updated by our team as needed and on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads of a new version of the app.

“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ 
Katya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.

“Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”
Shahin Tabatabaei, MD
Mass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School

“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series.”

"Quit Heroin Addiction Calendar","App Diggity, LLC","N/A","com.heroinaddiction.calendar","Heroin addiction is a real thing, and not many people are willing to admit that. Heroin is an illegal drug, but thanks to a culture that promotes these types of drugs, it is easy to see why people end up addicted to heroin. 
 
Quit Heroin Addiction Calendar addresses the need to quit heroin, and helps you become accountable for making the changes happen!
 
Features:
1. Use our counter to track your progress down to the second.
2. Create your own reasons to quit heroin, or use one of our scientifically based facts about quitting.
3. Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.
4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed and stop heroin.
5. Our special panic button will help you send a text to a friend that may be able to help you and be an accountability partner.
6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success.
7. Our distractions section will help you take your mind off of heroin and introduce you to something more positive and soothing.
8. Our built in money calculator will show you how much money you have saved since quitting
9. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake your heroin addiction. 
10. Our built in time counter will let you know how much time you save per day since quitting. 
 
Here are our top 10 reasons to quit heroin:
 
1. You will improve your physical and mental health
 
Heroin addiction destroys the physical body. You’ll feel sick all of the time, you’ll feel weak and you’ll likely spend more time curled up on the bathroom floor than anywhere else. Heroin addiction also does extensive damage to mental health. The National Institute on Drug Abuse states, “Repeated heroin use changes the physical structure and physiology of the brain, creating long-term imbalances in neuronal and hormonal systems that are not easily reversed.” 
 
2. Mended relationships with your family and friends. 
 
No one likes to be completely alone and isolated – as human beings, we need to form meaningful relationships with others in order to be truly happy. Active addiction separates us from those closest to us. It ruins the relationships we used to hold near and dear, relationships with our parents, our children, our siblings and our closest friends. Quitting heroin means that you’ll be able to work towards healing these damaged relationships. 
 
3. You won’t have to worry about legal issues anymore. 
 
The stress of heroin addiction takes many different forms, one of the most pervasive being ongoing legal issues. Heroin is an illicit drug, so any activity surrounding this specific chemical substance can get you in serious trouble with the law. However, many heroin addicts will start engaging in other criminal behavior in order to get more of the drug, such as theft.
 
4. You won’t have to worry about dying anymore.
 
In 2017, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported that there were a total of 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the country. This number doesn’t include the thousands of men and women that died during a heroin overdose and were revived with Narcan.
 
5. You’ll actually be able to save money and spend it on things that matter.
 
Heroin addiction is costly, and when you’re physically addicted to a chemical substance you won’t be able to successfully budget your money (no matter how hard you try). You probably won’t think to yourself, “Hey, I got paid today! I’ll put half in savings, pay my phone bill and then spend whatever is left on some heroin.” 
 
Having an issue with heroin is not uncommon in modern society. Unfortunately heroin is a very addictive substance and can cause long term damage. Kick your heroin addiction by downloading Quit Heroin Addiction Calendar for FREE!

"Pear reSET®","Pear Therapeutics Inc.","N/A","md.reset.reSET","reSET® is a 12-week prescription digital therapeutic for patients with substance use disorder, who are currently enrolled in outpatient treatment under the supervision of a clinician. reSET is the first FDA-authorized treatment shown to increase abstinence and retention over the 12-week trial duration (1,2).

Get therapy on demand.
Interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy lessons help you learn new skills you can use in everyday situations to support your recovery (2).

Strengthen coping strategies.
Questions at the end of each lesson help you remember important ideas and practice skills to stay in treatment (2).

Earn rewards. 
Use an evidence-based rewards system designed to support your recovery and treatment (2). 

Track your cravings and triggers.
Record substance use, cravings, and triggers with just a tap, so you and your therapist or doctor can better understand how you’re doing (2). 

If you’ve been in an outpatient treatment program before for substance use disorder, you know that recovery can be a challenging, ongoing process. Especially in between therapy sessions, when you may not be able to access a counselor or doctor but still need support. 

reSET is a Prescription Digital Therapeutic—a new type of therapy prescribed by doctors designed to help with treatment. It lets you continue the work you’re doing in recovery on your smartphone or tablet, so you can build new skills and get support—anytime, anywhere.


Important Safety Information

Warnings/precautions: Do not use reSET to communicate any emergency, urgent or critical information. reSET does not include features that can send alerts or warnings to your clinician. If you have feelings or thoughts of harming yourself or others, please dial 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

reSET is intended for patients whose primary language is English, who have access to a compatible tablet or smartphone and are familiar with the use of smartphone applications (apps). You should be able to upload data periodically, i.e. have internet/wireless connection access.

reSET requires you to enter a user name and password prior to use. Please do not share your user name and password with others. reSET may contain and transmit protected health information and/or personally identifiable information.

reSET is not intended to be used as stand-alone therapy for substance use disorder (SUD) and does not replace care by your provider. reSET is not a substitute for your medications. You should continue to take your medications as directed by your provider.

The long-term benefit of treatment with reSET on abstinence has not been evaluated in studies lasting beyond 12 weeks (90 days) in the SUD population. The ability of reSET to prevent potential relapse after treatment discontinuation has not been studied. The safety and effectiveness of reSET has not been established in patients enrolled in opioid treatment programs.

"Recovery Birthdays","Kurt Lane","N/A","Kurt-Lane.Recovery-Birthdays","For a person in recovery, their Sobriety date, Clean date or Abstinence date is just as important, and often more important than their 'belly button' birthday.

Recovery Birthdays is a contacts manager that syncs with your current contacts, easily allows you to add and manage your friends recovery birthdays and sends you notifications before and on your friends anniversaries. 

Your data never leaves your device. One of the main priorities I had when creating this app was the privacy of the users and their contacts. No data collected. Not third party servers. No sharing of your data with anyone. Recovery Birthdays does not collect information of any kind from its users. Recovery Birthdays stores locally in the app only a contact name, date for an anniversary of the recovery birthday and a single image for the contact. Recovery Birthdays does not store or share your contacts other information such as, phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, contact notes, birthday, job or relations. 

When we were drinking and using we had ""dropped out"". Never sending cards, returning phone calls, being there for other people or taking part in their lives. Only through positive action can we remove the remains of guilt and shame brought on by our disconnection from others. Because of God's grace, we have been given a second chance at life and the opportunity to change the future. 

Be a part of the fellowship that is being freely offered to you and take part in others lives by remembering their recovery birthdays! Bring them a cake, write them a card, give them a call or send them a text message. It is only through giving that we truly receive. They will be most grateful you remembered.

*Configure notifications for the day of the recovery anniversary and a day before the anniversary.
*Send an image from the app of a sobriety coin or recovery key-tag on the anniversary. The app contains Sobriety coins and key-tags from 24 hours to 60 years.
*Create new contacts or add a recovery anniversary to an existing contact.
*Choose from ‘Sobriety date’, ‘Clean date’ or ‘Abstinence date’ when adding a contact.
*Recovery Birthdays will sync with Contacts automatically for contacts that contact an 'anniversary date' with the label of either ‘Sobriety Date’, ‘Clean Date’ or ‘Abstinence Date’

"Triggered - Overcome Addiction","Triggered","N/A","com.solid.triggered","Do you or someone you know struggle with addictions? Don't do it alone! The Triggered app makes it easy to reach out for support and encouragement. With just one click, instantly notify your support group when you are feeling triggered. Find freedom and overcome addiction with Triggered.


Triggered Alerts
If you are struggling with addiction, simply subscribe for the Triggered app, download the app and build your support team. When you are feeling Triggered, all it takes is one click of a button and we will notify your team via text, email and push notifications. They will respond to you with support and encouragement you need to overcome. 

Support Made Easy
Reaching out when you are feeling triggered is so powerful, yet so difficult to do. It is hard to pick up the phone and call someone when you are struggling. What if all it took was just one click? One click to notify your team that you could use some support and encouragement. Instead of calling them, they now can call you. One second of courage is all it takes to overcome your temptations!

You are not Alone
If you have ever tried to overcome addiction on your own, you know how hard it is. It’s time to stop battling alone and let someone come alongside you. You are never too far gone. There are many people who want to support and encourage you. There are people who care and want to help you find victory. You are loved…

Partner Alerts
If someone you know is struggling with addictions, let them know about the Triggered app and start making a difference today. As someone’s support partner, you will have access to their alerts in the Triggered app, with no subscription needed. You can respond to their alerts quickly with one click of a button. In addition to a quick response, we also help you be most effective by allowing you to send a custom text message from the app, dialing them from within the app or setting a reminder to reach out later when you are available. We want to help you as you make a difference.

Trigger Trends and Reports
We want to help you break free from your triggers. That is why we are in the process of developing “Trigger Trends”. Trigger Trends and Reporting will help you understand when you are most often triggered and the circumstances behind them. With a greater understanding of the “why” behind your actions, you can make the choices that will help you break out of the habitual patterns that keep you trapped.
After you trigger an alert, you will have the opportunity to log the situation and your emotions. We will provide you with reports and trends based on the information you provide in your alert details. Start understanding the reasons behind your struggles and overcome your temptations!

Escape Plan
Once Triggered Trends and Reports have been established, we will be developing an Escape Plan to help you be proactive in your healing. Based upon your alerts and details, we will help you find ways to break out of the cycle with new, proactive ideas. Find better ways to overcome your triggers, with the Escape Plan!

Subscriptions
Freedom is priceless and yet, cheaper than addiction! We make priceless affordable. How much is your freedom worth to you? Find more information about individual subscriptions as well as future plans for group subscriptions.

"Addiction Avert Plus","Reflections of the Heart","N/A","com.rationalsoberliving.addictionavertplus","Addiction AVERT, Rational Reflections 501(c) 3 non-profit

FREE download! Addiction AVERT is a substance abuse craving reduction technique that can help individuals challenge cravings in the immediacy by bringing up realistic events and situations that will happen if they choose to use drugs, alcohol or smoke and what they will lose. AVERT can be customized to help motivate an individual’s personal recovery program and works with a sponsor.   

The organ that is diseased in addiction is the mid-brain which is the part of the brain responsible for our survival (food, sex, fight or flight). The cerebral cortex is responsible for logic, reasoning and moral functioning.   

For the most part the cerebral cortex has power over the mid-brain but in addiction this top down control is lost. The mid-brain actually hijacks the cerebral cortex and makes logic, reasoning and morality a liability, allowing for continued use and the continuation of harmful consequences.

AVERT helps interrupt this process and restore the top down control needed to successfully interrupt the mid-brains cruel tool (craving); restoring the cerebral cortex leading to rational thinking, which leads to abstinence for the alcoholic and drug addict.
