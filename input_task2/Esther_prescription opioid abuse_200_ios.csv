Drug Addiction AKA Substance Abuse is a mental health disorder characterized by compulsive drug seeking & usage despite significant adverse consequences. 

While there are millions of drugs out there, the most common addictive drugs are opioids, tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, benzodiazepines, and stimulants.

If you are concerned about your drug usage, it is important to seek treatment as soon as possible. Nearly 10% of the US population would benefit from treatment for a drug or alcohol use problem. Talk to your physician about treatment options.
