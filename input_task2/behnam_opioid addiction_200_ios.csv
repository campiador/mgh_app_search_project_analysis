"eOpioid™ : Opioids & Opiates Calculator","SentientWare","N/A","com.sentientware.eopioid","INTRODUCTION
eOpioid™ is a sophisticated application with a suite of different functions that can perform complicated opioid pain medication dose calculations.  It can assist healthcare professionals determine proper doses of different opioid pain medicines for patients who may already be using opioids or are opioid tolerant.

(Opioids are sometimes also referred to as opiates or narcotics.)

POWER
Other conventional opioid dose calculators may use the traditional method of simply converting the number of milligrams of one opioid to the number of milligrams of another opioid using a single conversion factor.

eOpioid™, however, is able to produce more complicated calculations for opioids such as methadone or levorphanol, in which the equianalgesic dose is actually not a single value, but a relatively large range of possible values.

VERSATILITY
eOpioid™ not only calculates the number of milligrams for the new, replacement opioid of interest, but searches its database for the replacement opioid's available different sizes of tablets or patches and available dosing time intervals.  It can then display the new opioid dose in terms of a potentially more useful output, such as “morphine ER 30 mg tablet, 1 orally q 8 hours”, rather than just stating “morphine 90 mg”.

An almost unlimited number of separate opioids that a patient may be using can be entered for consideration.  If a patient is simultaneously using many different opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, etc, these can all be entered.

EXTENSIVE
eOpioid™ has additional functionality to assist clinicians choose appropriate settings for Patient-Controlled Analgesia devices for IV opioids, such as for morphine, hydromorphone, and fentanyl for patients who may be opioid-tolerant.

eOpioid™ has an extensive database of both long-acting and short-acting opioids.  It can assist you in determining the doses for a regimen consisting of a long-acting opioid to be given around-the-clock with a short-acting opioid to be given on an as-needed basis (i.e. “PRN”).

FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION
Even with the multitude of different features offered with eOpioid™, its interface is refreshingly clean and logical.  It was designed to be intuitive and is a true example of form following function.



Please note that this software is not capable of performing medical consultations.  eOpioid™ is an informational tool only and should only be used by specialized healthcare professionals.  You are required to read the extensive help documentation within eOpioid™ to ensure a thorough understanding of the Software's capabilities and limitations.

"Confidant: Healthy Habits","Confidant Health","N/A","live.safeopioidusecoalition.confidant","When you or someone you love is using drugs or alcohol, it can be hard to get help. 

Confidant is something new and different in addiction recovery.

Most addiction recovery clinics focus on 12-step based abstinence-focused sobriety. For many people, that path is outdated and doesn’t fit the lifestyle of those who haven’t hit “rock bottom”. 

We know there are millions of people, like us, who want to change the way they’re using drugs and alcohol without having to put their life on hold by going to drug rehab or an intensive outpatient program for the next 30 days to get sober.

So, we teamed up with modern-recovery researchers and patient advocates to dive into the latest scientific evidence and medical knowledge to uncover the best way to make changes to your alcohol or drug use.

What we found was a simpler way - focused on the person, not just the substance. You should not have have to uproot your life, question every choice you’ve ever made, and become an unrecognizable person. 

Addiction recovery should be person-centered, straightforward and judgment free. Whether that means Medication-Assisted Treatment like Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, etc. or online therapy we support a variety of paths.

Here’s how Confidant works:

- Download the app
- Start ReVAMP- our behavior change platform
- Speak with providers who can help you in 1:1 therapy
- Book online therapy appointments right in the app
- Meet with healthcare providers on your phone (they can help with Suboxone, Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, etc. if appropriate)

We provide everyone who uses Confidant access to a Matchmaker, who acts as your personal concierge and can answer any questions you may have and get you connected to all these resources.

Not interested in talking with someone about this yet? We get it. Talking about substance use is hard and it takes time to build trust. That’s why we created ReVAMP to guide you.

ReVAMP is our DIY behavior change program. Simply answer questions about your goals, activities and feelings and it will help you identify your core values. Next ReVAMP produces a personalized plan to help you unlock your best self by drinking less, using drugs less or quitting altogether.

At Confidant, we don’t judge. We’re here to help you and that’s it.

While there are millions of drugs out there, the most common addictive drugs are opioids, tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, benzodiazepines, and stimulants. 

Drug addiction is not a moral failure, but rather a disease that can be effectively treated with psychotherapy and medication, either inpatient or outpatient dependent on the severity.

This simulation targets primary care clinicians, and will offer information about the opioid crisis, the neurobiology of OUD, the effectiveness of medication, and treating patients with OUD with empathy. The simulation is grounded in real-world experiences and will capture the participant's decision points and performance; provide real-time feedback to participants on their decisions, errors, and missed steps; and proceed based on decisions by the participant during the simulation.

This simulation course was prepared with support through contract number Contract No. HHSS283201200002I/HHSS28342009T, Reference No. 283-12-0209 with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

reSET-O is a Prescription Digital Therapeutic—a new type of therapy prescribed by doctors designed to help with treatment. It works in conjunction with buprenorphine medication assisted therapy, and lets you continue the work you’re doing in recovery on your smartphone or tablet, so you can build new skills and get support—anytime, anywhere.

Important Safety Information

Warnings/precautions: Do not use reSET-O to communicate any emergency, urgent or critical information. reSET-O does not include features that can send alerts or warnings to your clinician. If you have feelings or thoughts of harming yourself or others, please dial 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

reSET-O is intended for patients whose primary language is English, who have access to a compatible tablet or smartphone and are familiar with the use of smartphone applications (apps). You should be able to upload data periodically, i.e., have internet/wireless connection access.

reSET-O requires you to enter a user name and password prior to use. Please do not share your user name and password with others. reSET-O may contain and transmit protected health information and/or personally identifiable information.

reSET-O is not intended to be used as stand-alone therapy for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and does not replace care by your provider. reSET-O is not a substitute for your medications. You should continue to take your medications as directed by your provider.

The long-term benefit of reSET-O has not been evaluated in studies lasting beyond 12 weeks (84 days) in the OUD population. The ability of reSET-O to prevent potential relapse after therapy discontinuation has not been studied.

If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you!

A number of features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:

• This publication is the only one in the market that offers dietary guidance for OUD AND its combination with the following most likely health issues: anxiety, constipation, dehydration, depression, HIV/AIDS, insomnia, leaky gut, liver well-being, magnesium deficiency, stress, vitamin D deficiency and weight loss.

Personal Remedies is the producer of the world's first e-dietitian and publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions. Based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.

Creation of this app was inspired by the Opioid Crisis Working Group (OCWG) of the StartUp Health Academy. Personal Remedies is a founding member. The OCWG’s goal is to provide an end-to-end, evidence-based solution to recovery clinics and their patients, addressing all the patients’ biological, pharmacological, psychological and sociological needs. This app is a component of that end-to-end solution.

The information presented by this app is updated by our team as needed and on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads of a new version of the app.

“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ 
Katya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.

“Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day.

"Quit Heroin Addiction Calendar","App Diggity, LLC","N/A","com.heroinaddiction.calendar","Heroin addiction is a real thing, and not many people are willing to admit that. Heroin is an illegal drug, but thanks to a culture that promotes these types of drugs, it is easy to see why people end up addicted to heroin. 
 
Quit Heroin Addiction Calendar addresses the need to quit heroin, and helps you become accountable for making the changes happen!
 
Features:
1. Use our counter to track your progress down to the second.
2. Create your own reasons to quit heroin, or use one of our scientifically based facts about quitting.
3. Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.
4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed and stop heroin.
5. Our special panic button will help you send a text to a friend that may be able to help you and be an accountability partner.
6. Our badge system allows you to be rewarded for your success.
7. Our distractions section will help you take your mind off of heroin and introduce you to something more positive and soothing.
8. Our built in money calculator will show you how much money you have saved since quitting
9. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake your heroin addiction. 
10. Our built in time counter will let you know how much time you save per day since quitting. 
 
Here are our top 10 reasons to quit heroin:
 
1. You will improve your physical and mental health
 
Heroin addiction destroys the physical body. You’ll feel sick all of the time, you’ll feel weak and you’ll likely spend more time curled up on the bathroom floor than anywhere else. Heroin addiction also does extensive damage to mental health. The National Institute on Drug Abuse states, “Repeated heroin use changes the physical structure and physiology of the brain, creating long-term imbalances in neuronal and hormonal systems that are not easily reversed.” 
 
2. Mended relationships with your family and friends. 
 
No one likes to be completely alone and isolated – as human beings, we need to form meaningful relationships with others in order to be truly happy. Active addiction separates us from those closest to us. It ruins the relationships we used to hold near and dear, relationships with our parents, our children, our siblings and our closest friends. Quitting heroin means that you’ll be able to work towards healing these damaged relationships. 
 
3. You won’t have to worry about legal issues anymore. 
 
The stress of heroin addiction takes many different forms, one of the most pervasive being ongoing legal issues. Heroin is an illicit drug, so any activity surrounding this specific chemical substance can get you in serious trouble with the law. However, many heroin addicts will start engaging in other criminal behavior in order to get more of the drug, such as theft.
 
4. You won’t have to worry about dying anymore.
 
In 2017, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported that there were a total of 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the country. This number doesn’t include the thousands of men and women that died during a heroin overdose and were revived with Narcan.
 
5. You’ll actually be able to save money and spend it on things that matter.
 
Heroin addiction is costly, and when you’re physically addicted to a chemical substance you won’t be able to successfully budget your money (no matter how hard you try). You probably won’t think to yourself, “Hey, I got paid today! I’ll put half in savings, pay my phone bill and then spend whatever is left on some heroin.” 
 
Having an issue with heroin is not uncommon in modern society. Unfortunately heroin is a very addictive substance and can cause long term damage. Kick your heroin addiction by downloading Quit Heroin Addiction Calendar for FREE!

effectively. Use our distribution trends page to effectively show impact trends that your
organization has in your community. TxCOPE also has a kit building feature to help stay on
top of everything in your inventory even when items are grouped together in separate
bags. 
  
Data Dashboard: 
· View all your organization’s data using our pre-built graphs and heat-maps. If there are other

"Bio-Electrode Therapy","Les Moncrieff","N/A","com.les.moncrieff.Bio-electrodeTherapy","One out of five Canadians (and one out of three Americans) struggle with chronic pain. Meanwhile, opioid overdose is now a major cause of death for people under fifty. Since complex pain is so frequently the originating cause of opioid dependence, these two conditions have rapidly merged to form an alarming global crisis.

Bio-electrode Therapy offers a new, non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical treatment that significantly reduces or eradicates the pain of drug withdrawal, as well as many types of complex pain. Developed by a registered acupuncturist in Canada, with decades of clinical experience working with addictions, this therapy has demonstrated high effectiveness. The cost of the necessary supplies is minimal, and there are no side effects. Anyone in physical pain can learn to apply BeT protocols themselves. This application has been developed to provide people around the world with easy access to those protocols.
