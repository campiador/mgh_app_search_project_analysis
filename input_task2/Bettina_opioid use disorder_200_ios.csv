Drug Addiction Test,Inquiry Health LLC,N/A,com.drug.addiction,"Concerned about your substance use? This app helps you evaluate whether or not you may be addicted to drugs. It uses the Drug Abuse Screening Test, a validated screening questionnaire. 

Drug Addiction AKA Substance Abuse is a mental health disorder characterized by compulsive drug seeking & usage despite significant adverse consequences. 

While there are millions of drugs out there, the most common addictive drugs are opioids, tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, benzodiazepines, and stimulants. 

Drug addiction is not a moral failure, but rather a disease that can be effectively treated with psychotherapy and medication, either inpatient or outpatient dependent on the severity. 

If you are concerned about your drug usage, it is important to seek treatment as soon as possible. Nearly 10% of the US population would benefit from treatment for a drug or alcohol use problem. Talk to your physician about treatment options. 

Disclaimer: This is NOT a diagnostic test. Please consult a mental health professional if you are concerned about your drug use.
